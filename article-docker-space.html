      <h1>Let's go to Docker space!</h1>
      <p class="TBD">Under construction <i>(draft)</i></p>
      <p>
        Leave incompatibilities on the ground and take flight. Any application
        can be placed in a container and forgotten. Although, there are some
        caveats.
      </p>

      <h3>Set the stage</h3>
      <p>
        Our goal with using docker it's to achieve long term reproducibility and
        a deployment pipeline easily adoptable to change. We still have the need
        to be able to run the applications manually outside a CI/CD deployment.
        For the less techy users the look and feel using the application should
        be as close to the same as before.
      </p>
      <h3>Space is void and full of terrors</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Always be aware of the trade of's.</i>
        We will trade some speed and quite a lot of space for the benefit of
        having images easily accessible.
        <i>Run rootless whenever possible</i>. GUI passthrough is possible but
        the experience is not the best as it will rely on X forwarding.
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <i
        >I have wrapped NeoVim to showcase interactivity. This is a silly choice
        to show some of the things possible</i
      >

      <p>
        Ubuntu was chosen out of habit. There are other distributions that would
        help to keep the footprint of the docker down. This should be a
        consideration for our purposes. For longevity and reproducibility you
        should consider to have a process for publishing and pulling pre build
        docker images. Rebuilding them like in this example with <b>not</b> give
        your organization the those benefits even if it still might simplify
        shared tooling.

      <p>
        You will have quite a lot of choices to make to fit the exact purpose of
        the tool you are wrapping. I dearly recommend to read the
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/"
          >documentation</a
        >
        to solve your needs. The wrapper structure should be able to look the
        same. I ventured down the path of filtering the output data of the
        subprocess. This is doable, but the timeout was quite hard to get to
        work correctly with a poll strategy. The solution for that was way more
        involved and would have made for a to long and involved example.
        Noteworthy is that as we mount and change files on the host system we
        want to set this up such as it runs with the same privileges as the
        current user. This is only needed on the linux side in a rootful
        context.

        Minimal example of a instructions to make the scripts a installable pip
        package. Running <code>pip install .</code> in the root folder will
        install the wrapper and set the executable script. If you have done the
        set up of <code>PATH</code> you should be able to use
        <code>nvim</code> in your terminal and have it execute through the
        docker wrapper.
